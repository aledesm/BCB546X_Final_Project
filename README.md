# BCB546X_Final_Project

This is the repository of the final project for the Iowa Captives. Inside are the data files we used to replicate certain analyses from the paper "Comprehensive genotyping of the USA national maize inbred seed bank" by Romay et al. (2013), r scripts we used to analyze these data and produce figures, output files, the slideshow for the class presentation, and a markdown file to describe the paper, our approach and our results.
